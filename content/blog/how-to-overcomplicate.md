In January 2020, I was lucky enough to be selected as a speaker at [CodeMash](https://codemash.org/), an annual software development conference in Sandusky, OH. It is a _fantastic_ event which I highly recommend.

This was my first time speaking at a conference, so I made things up as I went along… Some things were easier than I expected, some were harder, and I learned a lot that should make my second conference talk even better.


## The First Easy Part: Deciding to Speak

Why did I want to do this now? Honestly, I’d always had it in the back of my mind as something that might be fun — and, just maybe, something I’d be good at. I’m passionate about code, tools, strategies – systems, really. How we do what we do, why we do it, how we can do better. I’m comfortable enough in front of an audience, and (to my co-workers’ occasional dismay) perfectly capable of going on (and on) about a topic. And I love teaching; wrapping something interesting and useful up in a story, helping someone get it the way that _I_ get it, hopefully passing along my excitement.

There were two catalysts for the talk I gave.



1. During our [hiring round](/blog/iterating-on-our-hiring-process/) last year, I had some great conversations with people who were less-familiar with [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/), and found that I loved walking through the core concepts, and that I had an easy time explaining why I, at least, loved to work this way.
2. While listening to two developers I admire on [one of my favorite podcasts](https://www.relay.fm/radar/172), talking about all the reasons they were certain TDD _just wasn’t for them_, I had quite a [“someone is wrong on the internet”](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png) moment.

So I thought a “TDD for Skeptics”-type talk might be useful. And very likely fun.


## The Second Easy Part: Submitting

I’d been aware of CodeMash for a while, but hadn’t yet attended. It seemed like this talk might fit CodeMash’s relaxed-yet-incredibly-professional vibe.

I submitted my abstract:


> For the skeptical: Both new and more-seasoned devs -- especially solo practitioners -- can have a lot of misconceptions about TDD. Mostly of the "it's extra work, it's extra code, I can't ship tests, why would I test something simple and obvious" variety. But magic happens when the light bulb switches to "on".
>
> Walk through the design of a simple-enough class, showing along the way how initial assumptions are often wrong; how to avoid making those assumptions too early; throw away less code; and feel comfortable and safe when you *do* throw away code.

(Actually, I submitted abstracts for three talks. I’m grateful only this one was chosen - the other ideas weren’t nearly as strong, and in retrospect, writing more than one new talk in that amount of time would not have ended well.)

I waited.

They said “yes”!


## Self-Imposed Roadblock #1: Failing to Ask for Help

You know that terrible interview cliché, “What are your greatest weaknesses”? In my case, the one that leaps to mind is my tendency to want to handle things myself and not bother anyone. I don’t think this is unusual in our profession.

CodeMash has a wonderful speaker-mentorship program, wherein experienced speakers offer advice/feedback/etc. to first-time speakers. I’m no fool, I signed right up for that! And then… never used it. Bob and Russell, thank you for your kind offer to help. I really wish I’d taken advantage of it.

I also work with a great team who were more than happy to look things over ahead of time. Again, I didn’t give them the chance. They’ve given great feedback after seeing the video of my talk, and that will be great in March when I give an updated version of the talk at [Orlando Code Camp](https://orlandocodecamp.com/); I regret not having those improvements baked in the first time.


## Self-Imposed Roadblock #2: Writing My Own Presentation Software


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Writing your own slide-presentation app is a bad idea, even if you really want that one extra feature. Anyway, here’s the thing I cobbled together to deliver my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CodeMash?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CodeMash</a> presentation. Do as I say, not as I do (or at least do it better). <a href="https://t.co/mXAptK7uqL">https://t.co/mXAptK7uqL</a></p>&mdash; Paul Roub (@paulroub) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulroub/status/1225480448496807938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To be clear, this wasn’t _just_ for fun. As part of my presentation I wanted to show test failures — and subsequent successes — live, as I went through the slides. So of course, I wrote a whole web app that served up the presentation; showed my notes in another window; and performed Git checkouts behind-the-scenes.

I think I ran live tests three times during the actual presentation. Static content would probably have sufficed.

It was still fun to write, though.


## Complications I’ll Try to Avoid Repeating

I rewrote too many slides, too many times. That time would certainly have been better spent practicing the actual delivery a few more times, or attending another session, or maybe playing in the water park. (CodeMash is at the Kalahari Resort, which has a water park. Like I said, I recommend the daylights out of this conference)

I also tried to write in the hotel room for the first day, which I’ve found just doesn’t work well for me. There was a perfectly nice speaker’s lounge, and once I migrated there, everything was much more focused and easy. Your mileage may vary.

I’d booked a return flight for Friday night, the last day of the conference. The flight was at 8pm, the conference ended at 5, it seemed like just enough time. I’d miss the closing ceremonies, but that seemed like a small price to get home sooner.

Then, a month before the conference, the flight schedule was changed. 7:15pm. No later options that didn’t involve overnight stays in some far-flung airport. “Well,” I thought, “as long as my talk isn’t scheduled for the last slot on Friday, I can leave early and make the flight.”

A week later, the conference schedule was published. Guess what?

I was able to add a night and re-book for the following morning’s flight, but all-in-all really wish I’d just done it that way in the first place. Cutting travel close, in the winter, in northeast Ohio, is a crap shoot anyway. I should know - I learned to drive in the northeast Ohio winter.


## Complications Which I Do Not Regret At All

I grew up in the Cleveland area, about an hour from the conference. I couldn’t resist finding a way to meet up with some old friends; and whenever possible, I’m inclined to find a way to be on stage with a guitar.

So I got in touch with the gentleman who runs a songwriters’ night at a Cleveland lounge, and booked myself a slot well in advance. This _did_ mean I missed the CodeMash Lightning Talks, which was regrettable. But in the midst of four solid days of sessions and rewrites, getting out was worth it (even if it meant getting to sleep well after 1am).

Oh, about that guitar. While I borrowed the host’s for the actual performance, I wanted to have one in the hotel room. 5 days is a long stretch to be without, after a lifetime of habitual noodling. Traveling with a guitar is expensive and risky, so I rolled the dice and visited a pawn shop halfway between the airport and the hotel.

The little old Epi stayed in tune, played easily, and sounded fine. Basically an $8-a-day rental, which I gave away at the end of the conference, to another attendee whose kid was learning to play. Still cheaper than flying it one-way. I’ll definitely do this particular silly thing again.

I also brought my own coffee and AeroPress, because I’m that sort of snob. And my favorite carbonated beverage, because… same.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Perfectly reasonable post-lunch routine at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/codemash?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#codemash</a>: green tea from the dining hall. Brew coffee while that cools (hotel coffee makers are just fine for making hot water). Drink green tea while refilling the water bottle (with Coke Zero). Head back downstairs. <a href="https://t.co/S36m59Kz6H">pic.twitter.com/S36m59Kz6H</a></p>&mdash; Paul Roub (@paulroub) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulroub/status/1215324810953351170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



And to get a feel for the slides on a big-ish screen, separate from the laptop, I HDMI-ed my way into the hotel room TV and used the nearest “podium”. As one does.

## The Good Part!

The talk itself was a blur and a blast.

I hoped there would be, I don’t know, 20 attendees? There were over 100. Almost all of them stayed, and I got heartwarming feedback immediately after, and later on Twitter and via the conference ratings.

I hoped I wouldn’t be stressed and miserable. Turns out? I loved it. All of it. I’m already keeping a list of possible topics to submit _next_ year, and I’m watching for other Calls For Proposals along the way.


## The Takeaway

Think you have a talk to give? Write it up. Submit it. Rejection is survivable, and you’ll have learned something for the next time.  And if it went this well despite all of my twists and turns, imagine the relative ease and satisfaction a _sensible_ approach might bring.
