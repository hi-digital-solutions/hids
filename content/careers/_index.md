## Who we are
HI Digital Solutions is a company with a social conscience. We’re an affiliate of Home Instead Senior Care®,  focused on delivering information and digital systems to aid the world’s largest home care business. Together we are tackling the growing problem of aging by delivering highly personalized care to seniors in their own homes.

Our mission includes: helping to build a learning culture, applying modern engineering practices, and facilitating effective organizational design within our business.  We work closely with teammates having years of experience in senior care, collaborating to understand and drive outcomes for our company and our customers.  We understand that changing culture can be challenging, and we strive to meet people where they are, and to treat everyone with respect.

We are a distributed company—our highly motivated, accountable, and talented people work from their home office, backyard, or wherever they are happiest.  We offer competitive salaries, full benefits, honor-system PTO, and a flexible schedule.

## How we work
From a process perspective, we follow XP and Lean practices.  We recognize that quality is essential to flow, and we invest heavily in automated testing and deployment, infrastructure as code, and pairing or mobbing for our work.  We highly value collaboration, working closely with our partners to deliver small slices of value and drive out learning quickly and iteratively.

We work with systems running on both Linux and Windows, using Python, JavaScript, C#, and Ruby.  We host our infrastructure in Azure, and leverage VMs, containers, and serverless architecture where appropriate.

## What we’re looking for
We need a full-time engineer to join our team and help us grow.

Are you familiar with the work of folks like Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim, Mike Rother and Dr. Eli Goldratt?  Do you want to work in small, collaborative teams, using TDD?    Are you interested in how technologies like containers and serverless frameworks can help deliver business value more quickly?  If so, [we want to hear from you](/join/)!
