## What we're looking for

Are you familiar with the work of folks like Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim, Mike Rother and Dr. Eli Goldratt? Do you want to work in small, collaborative teams, using TDD and continuous delivery? Are you interested in partnering with organizations to help achieve business goals, not just deliver software? If so, we want to hear from you!

We need full-time engineers to join our team and help us grow.  Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience to draw from, we have a place for you--we're committed to helping nurture people at all stages of their career.

Due to the complexity of international employment agreements, we are only able to consider candidates in the United States at this time.

## How we work

We are a distributed company: our highly motivated, accountable, and talented people work from their home office, backyard, or wherever they are happiest.

We help guide our partners in Lean and XP practices, and prioritize solving problems over writing code.

We recognize that quality is essential to flow, and we invest in automated testing and deployment, infrastructure as code, and pairing or mobbing for our work. We value collaboration, working closely with our partners to deliver small slices of value and drive out learning quickly and iteratively.

We work with a variety of systems and languages: Linux and Windows, Python, JavaScript, and C#. We leverage cloud architecture and serverless capabilities wherever we can, and place business value before shiny technology.  

## What we offer

In addition to a competitive salary and the flexibility of a distributed team, we offer a full benefits package including:

* Health Insurance  
* Dental Insurance  
* Vision Insurance  
* Health Savings Account (HSA)  
* Flexible Spending Accounts (Health; Dependent Daycare/Eldercare)  
* Life Insurance (Basic & Additional Voluntary Coverage for Employee, Spouse and/or Children)  
* Short Term Disability  
* Voluntary Long Term Disability  
* Voluntary Long Term Care Insurance  
* 401(k) Savings Plan  
* ~6 weeks PTO including holidays  
* Profit Sharing  


## Who we are

HI Digital Solutions, LLC is a company with a social conscience. We’re an affiliate of Home Instead, Inc.®, focused on delivering information and digital systems to aid a global franchisor for in-home senior care. Together we are tackling the growing problem of aging by delivering highly personalized care to seniors in their own homes.

Building on our successes, we are looking towards the future, branching out to help other franchise-based organizations realize their potential, and sharing the lessons we've learned.
