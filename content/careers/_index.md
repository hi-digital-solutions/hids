## Who we are

HI Digital Solutions helps businesses build a learning culture, apply modern engineering practices, and facilitate effective organizational design. We work with organizations who are leaders in their field, collaborating to understand and drive outcomes for our clients and their customers. We understand that changing culture can be challenging, and we strive to meet people where they are, and to treat everyone with respect.

We are a distributed company: our highly motivated, accountable, and talented people work from their home office, backyard, or wherever they are happiest. We offer competitive salaries, full benefits, and a flexible schedule.

## How we work

We help guide our partners in Lean and XP practices, and prioritize solving problems over writing code.

We recognize that quality is essential to flow, and we invest in automated testing and deployment, infrastructure as code, and pairing or mobbing for our work. We value collaboration, working closely with our partners to deliver small slices of value and drive out learning quickly and iteratively.

We work with a variety of systems and languages--Linux and Windows, Python, JavaScript, and C#. We leverage cloud architecture and serverless capabilities wherever we can, and place business value before shiny technology.  

## What we offer

In addition to a competitive salary and the flexibility of a distributed team, we offer a full benefits package including:

* Health Insurance
* Dental Insurance
* Vision Insurance
* Health Savings Account (HSA)
* Flexible Spending Accounts (Health; Dependent Daycare/Eldercare)
* Life Insurance (Basic & Additional Voluntary Coverage for Employee, Spouse and/or Children)
* Short Term Disability
* Voluntary Long Term Disability
* Voluntary Long Term Care Insurance
* 401(k) Savings Plan
* ~6 weeks PTO including holidays
* Profit Sharing
* What we're looking for
