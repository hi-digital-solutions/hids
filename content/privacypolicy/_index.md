We currently do not share your Personal Data with Third Parties and/or our Affiliates to offer products and/or services that may be relevant to you.

### Information We Collect and How We Use It

#### Personal Data

We collect information that you choose to provide us and that personally identifies you such as your name, telephone number, e-mail address, and other personally identifiable information ("Personal Data").  You may be asked to provide us with Personal Data when you inquire about our Services.  The decision to provide Personal Data is optional.  However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to send us inquiries or receive information about our Services.

#### Usage Data and Site Activity

We automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Site and in connection with using the Services through the use of cookies, server logs, and other technologies ("Usage Data").  We keep track of the pages visited by each user. Our web server automatically collects some information about you when you request pages from our server, including your IP address. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns.

We use this information to improve our Site, Services and User Experience by making it more responsive to the needs and preferences of our users. This information is also used to build an understanding of the functionality and services of interest to you, to share with third party analytics providers, advertising networks and search information providers, and to administer and protect our business and the Site including trouble shooting, data analytics, testing, system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting of data.

#### Click Path Tracking

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, pixels and scripts are used by H.I. Digital and our affiliates, our marketing, testing and quality assurance partners, and/or our analytics, information technology and web monitoring service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users' movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to help improve the Services and to help improve marketing, analytics, or Site functionality.

We use local storage ("LS") also referred to as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use local storage to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LS.

### How We Share Information

#### Generally

We currently do not share your Personal Data with third parties and/or our affiliates for their direct marketing purposes.  We also currently do not sell your Personal Data to any other third parties.  We may disclose Personal Data in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this Personal Data is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may have breached our Terms of Use or who may be causing (whether intentionally or unintentionally) injury to or interference with our rights or property, other website users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data to law-enforcement personnel and agencies when requested to do so, as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or if H.I. Digital is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets.

#### Third-Party Providers

From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe to be trustworthy and who we believe have privacy practices that are consistent with ours ("Third-Party Providers").  For example, we may contract with Third-Party Providers for the provision of certain services such as offering customer service, assessing quality and customer satisfaction, enabling website features, hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, or surveys, marketing and promotions.  We only provide our Third-Party Providers with the information necessary for them to perform services on our behalf.  Each Third-Party Provider is expected to use reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  These companies are authorized to use your Personal Data only as necessary to provide these services.

#### Social Media

Our Site includes social media sharing tools and features, such as Linked-In, Facebook, Twitter and may include "share" buttons and widgets, and interactive mini-programs (each a "Feature" and, collectively, the "Features"). These Features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Site and set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.

We also maintain profiles or accounts with various social media providers, including, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, (collectively, "Social Media Properties"). Your interactions with these Social Media Properties and/or the Features are governed by multiple privacy policies. Our collection use and disclosure of information obtained through the Social Media Properties and/or the Features is governed by this Privacy Policy to the same extent as information gathered through the Site; however, the privacy practices of the applicable social media provider are governed by the applicable social media provider's privacy policy. We encourage you to review the applicable social media provider's privacy policy before interacting with a Social Media Property and/or Feature.

### Security

The company recognizes the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personal Data.  Accordingly, we employ reasonable measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure and use.  However, due to the open communication nature of the Internet, no system can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data.  Any information you transmit on or through the Site or Services is done at your own risk.

### How Long We Retain Your Data

We retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it including for the duration of our relationship with you.  We also retain your personal data for a period of time after our relationship with you has ended where there is an ongoing need to retain it.  This includes retention to comply with our legal, regulatory, tax, and/or accounting obligations.  We do so in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable law.

### California Do Not Track Disclosure

Do Not Track is a web browser privacy preference that causes the web browser to broadcast a signal to websites requesting the user's activity that such activity will not be tracked. H.I. Digital’s Site does not respond to Do Not Track signals.
