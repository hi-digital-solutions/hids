We endeavor to be transparent and honest in all the activities we do at HI Digital Solutions.  There are no secrets in our hiring process.  The journey is simple, and you only need to take the first step.

## Apply
[Email](mailto:careers@hidigitalsolutionsllc.com) your resume and cover letter

## Program
When we contact you we'll ask you to complete a simple coding problem in [cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/) so we can see how you test drive your code.

## Interview
We'll contact you for an interview where we discuss you, your career, and experiences in a non-'gotcha' format.  Interviews will always be conducted by at least two members of our team.

In addition you'll get an opportunity to interview usâ€¦ so don't forget to come with your questions!

## Pair
We are strong believers in the benefits of pair programming; with this activity you'll get to pair in on a deeper technical problem to show your comfort in writing code with a pair partner.
