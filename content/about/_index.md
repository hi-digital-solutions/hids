Digital Solutions is a subsidiary of [Home Instead Senior Care](www.homeinstead.com), one of the largest and most successful home-care companies in the world.  Our company grew out of a need to change the way software was developed and used at Home Instead, and a recognition that growing a healthy IT culture could happen more easily with a bit of space.  
 
## Partnership, not just Outsourcing
For years, Home Instead relied on outsourced vendors for most of its IT needs.  In that time, they learned the same lesson that many other organizations have:  Outsourcing often fails to meet its goals, and it's easy for the incentives to get out of alignment.  Digital Solutions brings a partnership model to organizations we work with--we believe in setting up win-win engagements, and we define our success by the success of our partners.

## Strategy, not just Execution
As organizations grow, they often outpace their existing IT capabilities--the tools and culture that drove the org's successes in the past may be holding them back today.  While our technical skills are top-notch, our focus is on helping organizations realize their own potential; Digital Solutions helps chart a course towards continued success in the future, even after we part ways.

## Something to Learn, and something to Teach
Digital Solutions has been helping solve business problems for years; we've seen missteps and big wins, and along the way we've learned a lot.  Every organization is different, and there's no single recipe for success--we can provide insight about what works in other places, and help avoid the pitfalls, but we learn from every team we work with.  We help organizations achieve their goals, and we believe that every partner we work with helps us improve as well.
